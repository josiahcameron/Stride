Stride is a full-stack habit-tracking web application that propels you to reach your goals with a focus on self-accountability. Keep completing your daily goals to level up and add more as you make strides toward your best self!

Objectives/Outcomes:

-   Use Django to build a full-stack website where users can track daily habits. Users are limited to how many habits they can add based on tier. Tiers increment depending on how many days the user completes.

-   Set Up user authentication and authorization to register and log users in to access their own habits.

-   Use data stored in relational databases: Users and their habits have meta data associated with each stored to their own relational databases. Habit's meta checks whether or not that particular habit is completed for that day. User's data tracks their progress towards their next tier as well as their streak for consecutive days completed.

-   Utilize a RESTful API using Django Rest Framework that implements CRUD, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete their own habits. Users can also create their own journal entries.

-   Access API to give users a random daily motivational quote.

-   Utilize Twilio API to send a text message upon goal completion.
